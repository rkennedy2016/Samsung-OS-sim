# 💙 SamsungOS
A cursed yet beautiful parody OS simulator—combining the sleek polish of Samsung’s One UI with all the glitchy, chaotic energy of retro internet pranks and MEMZ.exe vibes.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, **SamsungOS** is a nostalgic simulation that boots like a flagship device... then quickly spirals into beautiful absurdity. Toast your camera, summon Odin Mode, and unleash pop-up hell—all in glorious safety.
